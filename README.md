## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This challenge was nice practice for my layout skills and JavaScript DOM manipulation. I enjoyed creating the mobile and desktop versions of the social media share buttons. While I still need more practice, I did try my best to make the code as DRY as possible and use better naming conventions.


### Continued development

Moving forward I would like to practice using the BEM naming convention, better transitions and improving my knowledge on accessibility. 


### Useful resources

- [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - I use CSS-Tricks whenever I have any questions or doubts on CSS. I use it to freshen up on Flexbox and Box-shadows.

## Acknowledgments

While trying to figure out how to make the desktop version of share icon change color upon clicking on it work, looking at the code for [@palgramming](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/palgramming) solution to this challenge really helped me come up with my own solution for it.
